Objective: Maximize f(x,y) with multiple peaks
Search space: x,y âˆˆ [-3, 3]
Evaluations per method: 50

RESULTS:

Bayesian (GP):
  Best value: 3.7299
  Location: (-0.012, -0.015)
  Time: 5.661s

Grid Search:
  Best value: 3.7252
  Location: (0.000, 0.000)
  Time: 0.001s

Optuna TPE:
  Best value: 3.2277
  Location: (-0.481, -0.514)
  Time: 0.208s

Random Search:
  Best value: 2.4443
  Location: (0.136, -0.435)
  Time: 0.001s


CONCLUSION:
This comparison demonstrates how different optimization methods
explore the search space and converge to the optimum.
Model-based methods (Bayesian, TPE) typically perform better
on complex functions with multiple peaks.
