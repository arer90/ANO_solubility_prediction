# AD Interpretation Report: Lovric2020_logS0

## AD Coverage Analysis

### Coverage Statistics

No coverage data available.


## Chemical Space Analysis

### Chemical Space Coverage

- **Number of Descriptors**: 0
- **Feature Space Dimensionality**: 0D

**Chemical Diversity Assessment**:
- Use molecular fingerprints to assess chemical diversity
- Monitor scaffold diversity in training set
- Ensure adequate representation of chemical classes


## Model Reliability Assessment

### Model Reliability Zones

**High Reliability Zone** (Inside AD):
- Compounds similar to training data
- Predictions have higher confidence
- Suitable for regulatory submissions

**Medium Reliability Zone** (AD Boundary):
- Compounds at the edge of training space
- Predictions require additional validation
- Consider experimental verification

**Low Reliability Zone** (Outside AD):
- Compounds dissimilar to training data
- Predictions are extrapolations
- High uncertainty, use with extreme caution


## Practical Applications

### Recommended Applications

**Drug Discovery Applications**:
- Virtual screening of compound libraries
- Lead optimization campaigns
- ADMET property prediction

**Regulatory Applications**:
- ICH guidelines compliance
- OECD QSAR principles adherence
- Regulatory submission support

**Decision Making Framework**:
1. Check if compound is inside AD
2. Assess prediction confidence
3. Consider experimental validation if needed
4. Document AD assessment in reports
